## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/caliben909/super-duper-lamp.git
   cd super-duper-lamp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
    - Copy `.env` and update it with your actual values:
      - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum private key (keep secure)
      - `INFURA_API_KEY`: Your Infura API key for RPC access
      - `GODMODE_EMPIRE_ADDRESS`: Address of the deployed GodModeEmpire contract (after deployment)

4. **Compile the contracts:**
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

6. **Deploy contracts to Arbitrum:**
   - Ensure your .env has a valid PRIVATE_KEY
   - Run:
     ```
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-godmode-empire.js --network arbitrum
     ```
   - Note the deployed contract address and update .env if needed

7. **Run the AI bot:**
   ```
   node empire-ai.js
   ```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 14.0.0
- npm
- An Ethereum wallet with ETH on Arbitrum for gas fees
- Access to Arbitrum network (via RPC or WebSocket)
- Moralis API key for price checking
- Nodereal API key for enhanced RPC access

## Contracts

- `GodModeEmpire.sol`: Main arbitrage contract with flash loan strategies
- `SkimRouter.sol`: Swap router with fee mechanism

## Scripts

- `empire-ai.js`: AI script that monitors and executes arbitrage opportunities
- `atomic-multicall.js`: Executes atomic batch transactions using Multicall3 for guaranteed all-or-nothing operations
- `fetchArbitrumTokens()`: Fetches token list from CoinGecko

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```
npx hardhat test
```

This will list all token addresses and verify contract functionality.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

The bot includes comprehensive startup tests to verify:
- Environment variables configuration
- RPC provider connections
- Wallet and contract deployments
- Price quoting functionality
- Flash loan provider initialization
- Cross-chain bridge setup
- MCP Distributor wallet configuration

For backtesting, set `DRY_RUN=true` in your `.env` file to simulate trades without execution.

## Security Notes

- Use hardware wallets or secure enclaves for private keys
- Never store private keys in `.env` files in production
- Monitor gas costs and slippage to avoid losses
- Test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet deployment
